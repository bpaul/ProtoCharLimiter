Char Limiter
============
A simple unobtrusive javascript class for limiting the length of text input into a text field. Written for prototype

Usage
=====
Include charlimiter.js
Include charlimiter.css   - Optional, you may want to just add the styles to your stylesheet


In your HTML declare your textarea as follows:
<textarea class="char_limiter" counter="counter_name"></textarea>

Add a div for the counter:
<div id="counter_name"></div>

And that's it!

Options
=======
max: 140
By default the max number of characters is limited to 140 (ie a tweet). You can change this by adding max=<some number> to your textarea.

limit: false
By default the max is a 'soft' max. IE the users can continue counting and the counter will go negative. To make this a 'hard' max

An example with these options would be:

<textarea class="char_limiter" counter="counter_name" max=240 limit='true'></textarea>
